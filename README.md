# ALX Project: Reactify TS â€“ Mastering Advanced TypeScript in React

Welcome to **Splash App** â€“ a learning-focused Next.js project built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and component-based architecture. This project is part of my journey with the ALX Software Engineering program, focusing on clean layouts, routing, and advanced TypeScript practices in React.

## ðŸš€ Project Setup

Created using:

- **Next.js** (App structure, routing, data fetching)
- **TypeScript** (Type-safe component interfaces)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first styling)
- **React Icons** (for social and UI icons)

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### 1. Shared Layout
- Built reusable `Header`, `Footer`, and `Layout` components in `components/layouts/`
- DRY structure: All pages automatically include the layout wrapper.

### 2. Custom Button Component
- Created a flexible `Button.tsx` with props for label, size, color, and actions.

### 3. Google Fonts Integration
- Used **Montserrat** via `global.css` for clean, readable typography.

### 4. Imperative Routing
- Implemented page navigation using the `useRouter` hook and custom buttons.

### 5. Interface Management
- All TypeScript interfaces are organized in `interface/index.ts` for easy reusability and maintenance.

### 6. Custom 404 Page
- Added a fun, styled custom 404 page using Tailwind and `react-icons`.
